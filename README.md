## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Set up your Google Gemini API key
# Create a .env file and add your API key:
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# Step 5: Start the development server with Vercel CLI (required for API routes)
npx vercel dev
```

> **Note:** This project uses Vercel Serverless Functions for the AI-powered code roasting feature. You must use `npx vercel dev` instead of `npm run dev` to test the API integration locally.
